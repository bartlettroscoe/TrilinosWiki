Welcome to the Trilinos Developer Website!

The Trilinos Project Homepage can be found at [trilinos.org](https://trilinos.org).

We are in the process of moving the old Developer site to GitHub, while updating content in the process. A specific plan will appear here when it is available.

## Links to related Trilinos Developers Sites

* **Old Trilinos Trac site:** http://trac.trilinos.org/

  * E.g. contains plan for adoption of the TriBITS Lifecycle model and everything that goes with that

* **Internal Sandia Trilinos Developers Site:** https://snl-wiki.sandia.gov/display/TRIL/Trilinos+Sandia+Internal+Developers+Site
