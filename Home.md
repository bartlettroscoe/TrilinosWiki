Welcome to the Trilinos Developer Website!

The Trilinos Project Homepage can be found at [trilinos.org](https://trilinos.org).

We are in the process of moving the old Developer site to GitHub, while updating content in the process. A specific plan will appear here when it is available.

**NOTICE:** Pull-request testing is now active and will soon be required.  This means direct push access will be eliminated and all submissions will need to come through pull requests on an as yet undetermined date. See ['feature'/'develop'/'master' workflow](VC-%7C-'develop'-'master'-workflow) for details.

**WARNING:** If you don't seem to be getting all of your notification emails from GitHub for updated Issues, etc., then have a look at the [GitHub Notification](GitHub-Notifications) page to see what you can do about that.
