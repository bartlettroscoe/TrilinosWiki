### Basic Notifications Help
GitHub provides a variety of ways to control what information you receive from repository activities. There is substantial documentation on GitHub.com.  For example, these two articles are good references:

- [https://help.github.com/articles/about-notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/about-notifications)
- [https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notifications)

You can control your own notification setting here: [https://github.com/settings/notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications)

### Not getting all notifications by email?
However, these resources do not help with a problem we commonly experience with GitHub notifications: mysterious missing notifications.  From time to time, some fraction of your notifications may not get sent to your email address. This may happen if your email system stops responding for a while and then GitHub messages bounce.  GitHub will flag your account and some fraction of messages will not get through.  

If you suspect that your account is throttled:
1. Go to [https://github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications) and check if there are notification listed that are not in your email.
2. If are missing some notifications, go to [https://github.com/contact](https://github.com/contact) and submit a request to have your account unflagged.
