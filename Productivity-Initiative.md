Software quality is certainly impacted by team-based processes, practices and tools.  Even so, each line of source is produced by a person.  The Productivity++ checklist is meant as a reminder to each person on the team to confirm that the work to be started right now is the **right thing to do** and is **being done right**.

### Personal Productivity Checklist:
When you start a work session, ask the question, Is my work [Traceable, In Progress, Sustainable, Improved]?

1. **Traceable:** 
  * _Task is planned and recorded in the Trilinos GitHub issues database._
  * _Task is traceable back to core requirements._
  * _Stretch: There are specification and design artifacts for this task._
2. **In Progress:**
 * _In the context of a Kanban workflow [[Minibook](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook)][[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5By0zzn2zNg)], this task is the most effective use of my time._
 * _This task is listed in the “In Progress” column of the Trilinos Kanban board._
 * _My “In Progress” queue size is within personal or small group limit._
 * _Stretch: Backlog has been recently scanned and [refined (groomed)](http://www.leadingagile.com/2014/11/replacing-backlog-grooming/)._
3. **Sustainable:**
 * _Output is high quality work, usable until the end of its expected life._
 * _Testing is sufficient for confident refactoring in the future._
 * _Stretch: Code, including test suite and associated documentation, is good enough for someone else to support after I move on to other work._
4. **Improved:**
 * _The quality of my work better than six months ago:_
    * _More consistent programming discipline._ 
    * _Learned new skills._
    * _Read literature, took on-demand or in-person training courses._
